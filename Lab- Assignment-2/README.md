##Tasks Completed


Generated a 3×3 matrix of random integers (1-50) without a fixed seed.   


Generated a 3×3 matrix of random integers (1-50) using np.random.seed(10) for reproducibility. 


Explained the difference between setting a seed and not setting a seed in random number generation.  



##Concepts Covered 


Using NumPy to generate random matrices and control randomness.

Understanding the role of randomness vs. reproducibility in simulations.

Real-world applications of random number generation, such as machine learning, simulations, and testing.   



##Key Takeaways   


Learned how to create and manipulate random matrices using NumPy.

Understood the importance of setting a seed for repeatable results in simulations.

Explored how randomness influences data generation and why controlled randomness is valuable.
